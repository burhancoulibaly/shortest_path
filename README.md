This is a path finding app, that I want to turn into a multiplayer game. Its using react for the front end, and nodejs for the backend as well as google firestore for a database. When visiting the site a user can login as an existing user create an account, or login as a guest. Guest users as of right now can enter sandbox mode and play with creating a map and using the different implemented path finding algorithms i.e A*. Authenticated users can create maps and save them as well as edit and delete them. When multiplayer is implemented other users will be able to access other users map and play around within them.
