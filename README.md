This is a path finding app, that I want to turn into a multiplayer game. Its using react for the front end, and nodejs for the backend as well as google firestore for the database. When visiting the site a user can login as an existing user create an account, or login as a guest. Guest users as of right now can enter sandbox mode and play with creating a map and using the different implemented path finding algorithms i.e A*. Authenticated users can create, save, edit and delete maps. When multiplayer is implemented other users will be able to access other users map and play around within them.
